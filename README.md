## Tic-Tac-Toe
 As a part of the Microsoft Engage 2020 program we were asked to prepare an AI Powered Tic-Tac-Toe Game using the Minimax Algorithm and to present it with a web interface.The Algorithm has been written in JavaScript and the web interface has been developed using HTMl5,CSS and Javascript.Mongo database has been used as Database service to store the scores of various users who play the game.The Game has two parts: Human vs Ai and Human Vs Human. The first part has several difficulty levels which range from being completely random to being unbeatable. We have also provided the game with a HINT Feature where the user when unable to decide upon a move could refer to for help. In the following follow up we explain the minimax algorithm which powers the game along with the rules of the game and the scoring pattern.The app has been hosted on glitch.
